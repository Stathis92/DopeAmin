</br>Video game made with Unity

</br>Play here: https://stathis92.github.io/DopeAmin/

</br>Project description: This game was created with the Unity engine. The goal is to strengthen my resume portofolio with the usage of systems like endless map generation, dynamic enemy spawn system and a save-load mechanic.

</br>:joystick: Controls: 
</br>:keyboard: W, A, S, D - Movement. 
</br>:keyboard: P, Esc - Pause Screen. 
</br>:computer_mouse: Left-MouseClick - to select options.

</br>:video_game: You start the game as the Knight character which has the whip weapon by default.
</br>Weapon upgrades: 
</br>-Knife (throw a knife in the direction the player is facing).
</br>-Holy Nova (An AoE circle that spawns on top of the knight which damages enemies when they enter in it).
</br>Passive upgrades:
</br>-Spinach (increases your base damage).
</br>-Wings (increases your movement speed).

</br>--:round_pushpin: TODO LIST & Roadmap--
</br>~-Endless terrain generator.~
</br>~-Create a playable Knight character.~
</br>~-Spawn system where we set the wave number and asign the enemyID and enemyCount for each wave.~
</br>~-Prop spawn system and drop/collect system.~
</br>~-XP system and levelUp screen(we take advantage of the screens to implement scene-transitions/ pause screen/ gameOver screen).~
</br>~-Upload build in gitHub and provide link to friends/family for some basic playtest.~
</br>~-Lighting: With the creation of a light system and adding some torches/campfires we give life to a game.~
</br>-Save&Load system.
</br>-Perma unlockable system: We achieve a Rogue-lite game which can be fun for the player.
</br>-Victory scenario: We have to make the player have a goal or the game will be forever boring.
</br>-More Playable characters.
</br>-More weapons and passive upgrades.
</br>-More enemies.
</br>-Bug fixing and playtesting with each step.
